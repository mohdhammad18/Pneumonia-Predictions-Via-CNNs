# Pneumonia-Predictions-Via-CNNs
Deep learning models for pneumonia detection from chest X-rays using custom CNNs and transfer learning (ResNet50, VGG19). Includes data preprocessing, augmentation, training, and evaluation scripts in TensorFlow/Keras. Performance is assessed with accuracy and ROC AUC, providing a practical framework for medical image classification research.
